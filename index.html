                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have a strong interest in mathematics, which has shaped my approach to computer science. My solid
                    understanding of mathematical concepts helps me appreciate algorithms, data structures, and
                    problem-solving. I enjoy finding logical patterns and applying them to practical solutions in
                    software engineering. I am also deeply interested in emerging technologies such as WEB3, Blockchain,
                    AI and Cloud Computing, and I look forward to applying them in real-world problem-solving.</p>
